# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the Keep Network!

## What do I need to know to help?

If you are looking to help to with a code contribution, our project uses:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Create App Boilerplate](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
- [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- [ES6](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/ECMAScript_2015_support_in_Mozilla)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

If you don't feel ready to make a code contribution yet, no problem! There are many ways to contribute to our community without writing code. You can submit bug reports or feature requests by opening an issue here in our repository. Outside of our repo, you can join the discussion about Keep in [Discord](https://discord.gg/wYezN7v), or even write a blog post or tutorial.

## How do I contribute?

### Find an issue or feature

Find an issue that you are interested in addressing or a feature that you would like to add. If you found a bug or want to suggest a new feature, do a quick search in our issues first to avoid creating a duplicate.

### Fork the repo

Fork our repo to your github account and create a new branch for your fix. When commiting, use succinct commit messages. Check out this [blog post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for the ideal commit format.

### Create a pull request

When you are ready, create a pull request to have your fix/feature reviewed by our maintainers. It's okay if it's not perfect, they will make suggestions to help you get there. Remember to ensure all tests pass before creating your request. Once all suggestions are appropriately addressed, your request will be merged. 

## Code of Conduct

Keep strives to facilitate a welcoming environment to contributors of all backgrounds and levels of experience. Help us uphold these values by keeping your language and conduct open, respectful, and considerate.
