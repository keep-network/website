questions:
  - question: What is the Keep network?
    answer: Keep is a privacy layer that enables private data to be leveraged on public blockchains without compromising the security or confidentiality. Keep is the network behind tBTC, the first secure and decentralized tokenized bitcoin on Ethereum. <a href="https://keep.network">Learn more about Keep.</a>
  - question: How does a keep work?
    answer: Keeps are core to the Keep network’s value proposition. The Keep network uses “private enclaves” known as keeps to securely encrypt and store private data. Off-chain keeps will be protected using secure multiparty computation (sMPC), generating, securing, storing, encrypting and transmitting data across many individuals.
  - question: What is a KEEP token?
    answer: The Keep Network's native token is KEEP. It powers the network and undergirds all the apps that are and will be built on it.
  - question: Is Keep live?
    answer: Yes! Keep is live.
  - question: How do I get KEEP tokens?
    answer: There are two ways to get KEEP tokens. You can buy tokens on an exchange. KEEP is available on Uniswap, Balancer, and Kraken. You can contribute to liquidity pools on Uniswap and earn KEEP as a reward.
  - question: How do I stake KEEP tokens?
    answer: You can stake KEEP tokens through the Keep staking dashboard. Stakers are able to operate a node themselves or delegate their KEEP to a staking provider. Visit the staking dashboard at <a href="https://dashboard.keep.network">dashboard.keep.network</a> to get started, or learn more about staking at <a href="https://staking.keep.network">staking.keep.network.</a>
  - question: Is there a minimum staking amount?
    answer: There is a minimum staking amount to stake on the Keep network as an independent node operator or with a staking provider. The minimum stake reduces over time on a set calendar. To learn about your options to earn KEEP even if you don’t have the minimum KEEP stake available, check out <a href="https://staking.keep.network/about-staking/staking-minimums">staking.keep.network/about-staking/staking-minimums</a>
  - question: What is the difference between “staking” and “stakedrop”?
    answer: Staking refers to the most complete way to stake on the Keep network. There are two variations of staking. You can stake with a minimum of KEEP tokens, or you can stake both the minimum KEEP and bond a desired amount of ETH in order to support the Keep network. By both staking KEEP and bonding ETH, stakers maximize their KEEP and ETH rewards. <br><br> Stakedrop just refers to any period of time during which KEEP rewards are available to stakers under a certain set of conditions.
  - question: What are the risks of staking?
    answer: Slashing in the Keep and tBTC systems is not designed to be punitive, and is rather to protect the security of the network from malicious behaviors. <br><br><a href="https://staking.keep.network/about-staking/staking-risks">Learn more at staking.keep.network/about-staking/staking-risks</a>
  - question: What are the rewards of staking?
    answer: Stakers are rewarded in both ETH and KEEP for staking on the Keep network, relative to how much KEEP they stake and ETH they bond. Rewards right now can be up to 200% APY for Keep stakers. <br><br><a href="https://staking.keep.network/about-staking/staking-economics">Learn more at staking.keep.network/about-staking/staking-economics</a>
