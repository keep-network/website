questions:
  - question: What is the Keep network?
    answer: Keep is a privacy layer that enables private data to be leveraged on
      public blockchains without compromising the security or confidentiality.
      Keep is the network behind tBTC, the first secure and decentralized
      tokenized bitcoin on Ethereum. <a href="https://keep.network/info">Learn
      more about Keep.</a>
  - question: How does a keep work?
    answer: Keeps are core to the Keep network’s value proposition. The Keep network
      uses private enclaves known as "keeps" to securely encrypt and store
      private data. Off-chain keeps are protected using secure multiparty
      computation (sMPC), generating, securing, storing, encrypting and
      transmitting data across many individuals.
  - question: What is a KEEP token?
    answer: The Keep Network's native token is KEEP.
  - question: Is Keep live?
    answer: Yes! Keep is live.
  - question: How do I get KEEP tokens?
    answer: You can buy KEEP tokens on an exchange. KEEP is available on Uniswap,
      Balancer, and Kraken. You can also contribute to liquidity pools and earn
      KEEP as a reward.
  - question: How do I stake KEEP tokens?
    answer: You can stake KEEP tokens through the <a
      href="https://dashboard.keep.network/">Keep staking dashboard.</a> Stakers
      are able to operate a node themselves or delegate their KEEP to a staking
      provider. Learn more in the <a href="https://staking.keep.network">staking
      user guide.</a>
  - question: Is there a minimum staking amount?
    answer: There is a minimum staking amount to stake on the Keep network as an
      independent node operator or with a staking provider. The minimum stake
      reduces over time on a set calendar. To learn about your options to earn
      KEEP even if you don’t have the minimum KEEP stake available, check out <a
      href="https://staking.keep.network/about-staking/staking-minimums">this
      section</a> of the staking user guide.
  - question: What is the difference between “staking” and “stakedrop”?
    answer: Staking refers to the most complete way to stake on the Keep network.
      There are two variations of staking. You can stake with a minimum of KEEP
      tokens, or you can stake both the minimum KEEP and bond a desired amount
      of ETH in order to support the Keep network. By both staking KEEP and
      bonding ETH, stakers maximize their KEEP and ETH rewards. <br><br>
      Stakedrop just refers to any period of time during which KEEP rewards are
      available to stakers under a certain set of conditions.
  - question: What are the rewards of staking?
    answer: Stakers are rewarded in both ETH and KEEP for staking on the Keep
      network, relative to how much KEEP they stake and ETH they bond. Rewards
      right now can be up to 200% APY for Keep stakers. <br><br> Learn more in

      href="https://staking.keep.network/about-staking/staking-economics">this
      section</a> of the staking user guide.
  - question: What are the risks of staking?
    answer: Slashing in the Keep and tBTC systems is not designed to be punitive,
      and is rather to protect the security of the network from malicious
      behaviors. <br><br> Learn more in <a
