    - title: Keep Network unveils v2 specs for tBTC protocol
      source: Cointelegraph
      excerpt: The second iteration of tBTC is expected to require stakers to only
        lock up Keep rather than both Keep and ETH, alongside introducing
        changes to its wallet-generation mechanism. The protocol allows users to
        tokenize their Bitcoin for use on the Ethereum network.

      excerpt: "Two encryption projects, Keep and NuCypher, both running on the
        Ethereum blockchain, have begun discussing what they are calling a “hard
        merge,” codename: Keanu. Crucially, this would be a merger of their
        protocols’ functions and communities, not of their companies."
