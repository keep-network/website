  title: Keep brings privacy to dapps
  body: <p>Keep secures private data on public blockchains with “keeps.” Keeps are
    off-chain containers that allow contracts to manage and use private data
    without exposing the data itself to the public blockchain.</p><p>In the tBTC
    solution, the private keys to the bitcoin are stored in keeps, where they
    cannot be exposed to the public Ethereum blockchain. Keeps are also
    distributed across validators, ensuring data remains not only private, but
    decentralized as well.</p>
